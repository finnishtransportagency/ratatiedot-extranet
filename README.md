## Project Structure

- It is monorepo architecture
- Monorepo uses a single repository for the source code management version control system
- Monorepo standardizes styling, code and tooling accross the team

## Tech Stack:

In Ratatiedot Extranet, we use:

1. React for user interface
2. Node.js for server-side implementation
3. AWS services: Cognito, Lambda, IAM, CodePipeline, CodeBuild and CodeDeploy, CloudWatch _(To-do: other AWS services to be decided)_
4. [aws-cdk](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) for defining and managing infrastructure and CI/CD Pipeline
5. Typescript to enforce type-checking

## Rules

### Branch management and naming

Based on GitLab Flow (see: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/gitlab_flow.html). Feature branches are branched from `main`.

Feature branchers should be name with the following naming convention:
commit_type/project_code-issue_number-feature_descriptive_name
E.g. `feature/RTENU-12345-awesome-new-feature`
If there is no issue, skip that part.

### Commit naming

Conventional commits (see: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), with the addition of a ticketing issue (if applicable/available).
E.g.

```
feat(api)!: RTENU-12345 Awesome new feature
Remade API to be more awesome, but with breaking changes
```

### Pull request

Feature branches are to be merged to `main` via Pull Requests. Use squash merging by default. If you need to retain intermittent commits for some reason, use regular merging in such case.

Naming: commit_type: PROJECT_CODE-ISSUE_NUMBER Description
E.g. `feat: RTENU-12345 Awesome new feature`

## Getting started

### Installation

Check node version. You can use `nvm use` to automatically set the right version.

To install a common dependency that both frontend and server can use, run command in the root repository:

```
npm install
```

To install dependencies that only frontend or backend use, for example, frontend application:

```
cd packages/frontend
npm install
```

Create `.env.development` file in server package and copy from `.env.example` to `.env.development`.

### Usage

- Run `npm run dev-server` to spin up server to serve API locally (http://localhost:8000)
- Run `npm run dev-client` to run React app locally (http://localhost:3000)
- Run `npm run dev` for full-stack development experience

### Build

### Pipeline

Bootstrap CDK for the AWS account, if that has not been done yet: `ENVIRONMENT=dev BRANCH=main cdk bootstrap`. ENVIRONMENT and BRANCH don't really matter here, but the stack requires you to set them.

To set up a new pipeline, run the deployment script (with up-top-date credentials for the preferred AWS-account). E.g. `npm run pipeline:deploy --environment=dev --branch=main` where environment is name of the environment you want to give (defaults are prod/dev) and branch is the Git branch you want to track for updates. The script will deploy CodePipeline, which will automatically set up the environment. The pipeline will automatically update itself and deploy any changes made to the app.

If you update the `pipeline:synth`-script name, you need to have the old script available for at least one commit in the followed branch or you have to rerun the deployment script by hand.

Note! A valid GitHub token with the scopes `admin:repo_hook, public_repo, repo:status, repo_deployment` is required to be had in AWS Secrets Manager. Refer to `./config/index.ts` for authenticationToken name to be set. Set the token as plaintext value.

Reference for pipeline setup: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/cdk_pipeline.html

### Testing

> ‚ùï We are in process of building automated testing/CI-pipeline. For now all tests needs to be run manually.

Running e2e/component tests with Cypress.

1. Start local server

```
npm run dev
```

2. Open Cypress GUI

```
npm run cy:open
```

Cypress GUI app should open. Select tests you want to run.

Optionally you can open [cypress CLI](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#How-to-run-commands) and run tests in commandline.

Cypress has has really good guides explaining how to use the framework.

3. Run tests in CLI

Recorded video is exported to videos folder.

```
npm run cy:run
```

### Linting

### Accessibility

Using `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` library to catch accessibility issues early on.

It is highly recommended to install and run accessibility tests using axe (https://www.deque.com/axe/) browser extension.
